Comments on 'Coding style'
--------------------------

Primary objective of used coding style is readability. For that spaces and
tabulators are used. Tabulator length is 8 spaces, but is not replaced by
spaces.

Lines are broken at 80th column. Sometimes, less spaces are used to fit line
within 80 columns. Names of variables and function are not short, instead their name
should give basic description on their purpose. Little more description is
placed before function code (in .c file).

There is no enforced coding rule style: everything is formatted for easy reading.
Proposed style is best presented on examples.

Clean code (using "strict" style) example:
-------------------------------------------
	if ( src_type == MSG_THREAD )
	{
		kthr = kthread_get_active ();
		thrmsg = kthread_get_msgqs ( kthr );
		kmsgq = &thrmsg->msgq;
	}
	else { /* src_type == MSG_QUEUE */
		msgq = src;
		kgmsgq = msgq->handle;
		ASSERT_ERRNO_AND_EXIT ( kgmsgq && kgmsgq->id == msgq->id,
					E_INVALID_HANDLE );
		kmsgq = &kgmsgq->mq;
	}

Type definitions:
------------------
/*! message */
typedef struct _kmsg_t_
{
	list_h  list;
	msg_t   msg; /* message (variable length!) */
}
kmsg_t;

Some argue that "kmsg_t" hide information, but I do not see any more
information on "struct kmsg_t" (as they propose), so I use shorter type
declaration.


When breaking line on function call, I try to align next line with parameters,
first with tabulator and last with spaces:

	arch_create_thread_context ( &kthread->context, start_func, param,
				     exit_func, stack, stack_size, proc );

If that is not possible, various adaptations are used:

example1:
		new_kthr = kthread_create (
			thrmsg->signal_handler,
			K2U_GET_ADR ( cmsg, proc ), proc->pi->exit, 0,
			kthread_get_prio ( kthr ) + 1, NULL, 0, 1, proc
		);
example2:
				if ( first->thread )
				{ /* alarm scheduled by thread */
				proc = kthread_get_process ( first->thread );
				kthread_create (
					first->alarm.action,
					first->alarm.param,
					proc->pi->exit,
					0,
					kthread_get_prio ( first->thread ) + 1,
					NULL, 0, 1,
					proc
				);
				resched_thr++;
				}
				else { /* alarm scheduled by kernel */
				first->alarm.action ( first->alarm.param );
				}

In example2 indentation in "if" is skipped so that code would not go to far
right and that function calls would not be extremely broken across lines.
